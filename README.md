## Fully Automated Luxury Rustic Cyberpunk

A small homestead in the woodlands, a little farm, and a tiny bit of technology to keep things going.

I keep a [small blog](http://rc.sh2.us), also [also on Tor](http://kpz62k4pnyh5g5t2efecabkywt2aiwcnqylthqyywilqgxeiipen5xid.onion/). Use the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/) to access the latter. I'm also available via email on RusticCyberpunk at Google's email silo. I'm "cypnk" on most sites and sometimes Twitter.
