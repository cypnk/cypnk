## Fully Automated Luxury Rustic Cyberpunk

A small homestead in the woodlands, a little farm, and a tiny bit of technology to keep things going.

I'm usually on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@cypnk), but I keep a [small blog](http://kpz62k4pnyh5g5t2efecabkywt2aiwcnqylthqyywilqgxeiipen5xid.onion/) on Tor. Use the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/) to access. I'm also available via email on RusticCyberpunk at Google's email silo. I'm "cypnk" on most sites, [and sometimes Twitter](https://sh2.us/twitter).
